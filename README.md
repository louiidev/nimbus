# ðŸ¥‘ guacamole ðŸ¥‘
A small toy game engine built in rust, built to learn game engine &amp; graphics programming.



## About

* Why another engine? I've always wanted to build a game engine and learn about how they work
* Who should use it? probably just me
* What's with the name? Github auto generated a suggested name that contained guacamole and I thought it sounded neat
* Heavily inspired by bevy and constantly used a reference when building features


## Goals
* 2D & 3D engine
* built in editor for managing/viewing entities on screen

### Foundations
* winit
* wgpu
* bevy_ecs
