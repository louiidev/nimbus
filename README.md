A small toy game engine built in rust, built to learn game engine &amp; gfx programming.


## Reason
I wanted to learn how to build a game engine from scratch and wanted to learn about graphics programming.

I've had many failed attempts so far but hopeful this because something I can use to build games with.




### Credit
A lot of code in this engine so far has been heavly inspried by bevy
